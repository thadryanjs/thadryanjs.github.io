I"<p>For most of the last few years, Iâ€™ve made wordclouds of famous speeches MLK to mark the holiday that bears his name - theyâ€™re <a href="https://sweeney-th.github.io/2018/01/16/in-honor-of-mlk-i-have-a-dream-wordcloud-example-in-r/">here</a> and <a href="https://sweeney-th.github.io/2020/01/20/in-honor-of-mlk-2020-i-have-a-dream-wordcloud-example-in-r/">here</a>. This year, I revisted the â€œI Have A Dreamâ€ speech with some new knowledge and tools and created the following as I reflected on the importance of the legacy of the day.</p>
