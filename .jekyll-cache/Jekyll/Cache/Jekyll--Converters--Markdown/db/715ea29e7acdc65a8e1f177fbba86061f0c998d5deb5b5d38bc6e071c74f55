I"„<p>Salutations!<br />
A friend of mine recently asked me for some pointers on Python import statements, and I thought I would share what I came up with. The import command allows us to use code from other libraries, directories, source files, etc. Itâ€™s a fundamental tools thatâ€™s been around since way before Python (think â€œ#include <stdio.h>\", and further). The structure is easier to demonstrate if we break from our go-to Jupyter format, so have a look at the project [here](https://github.com/sweeney-th/importsExample). Have a look at the code in utils.py, OtherUtils/utils\_one\_dir_down.py, and then read the mains!</stdio.h></p>
