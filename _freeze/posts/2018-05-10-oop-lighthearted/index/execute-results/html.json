I am writing to let you know that I have cleared the summit of a couple of beastly projects and will be back to working on the site at at the usual semi-regular pace soon. I am also working on some pieces that are a little larger and more detailed than usual, but the delays should (hopefully) be offset with quality. In the meantime, enjoy some easy-going code humor that doesn't want to hurt no one as evidence I am still around.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n### \"trait\" classes ###\nclass Picker(object):\n    \n    def pick(self):\n        print(\"I'm a picker...\")\n    \nclass Grinner(object):\n    \n    def grin(self):\n        print(\"I'm a grinner...\")\n    \nclass Lover(object):\n    \n    def love(self):\n        print(\"I'm a lover...\")\n    \nclass Sinner(object):\n    \n    def sin(self):\n        print(\"I'm a sinner.\")\n    \nclass Joker(object):\n    \n    def joke(self):\n        print(\"I'm a joker...\")\n    \nclass Smoker(object):\n    \n    def smoke(self):\n        print(\"I'm a smoker...\")\n        \nclass MidnightToker(object):\n    \n    def midnight_toke(self):\n        print(\"I'm a midnight toker.\")\n\n\n\n### composed class ### \nclass SteveMillerObj(Picker, Grinner, Lover, \n                     Sinner, Joker, Smoker, MidnightToker):\n    \n    def thoughts_on_hurting_someone(self):\n        print(\"I don't want to hurt no one.\")\n        \n    def how_loving_is_obtained(self):\n        print(\"I get my loving on the run.\")\n\n\n\n### usage ##\nSteve_Miller = SteveMillerObj()\n\n# use traits\nSteve_Miller.pick()\nSteve_Miller.grin()\nSteve_Miller.love()\nSteve_Miller.sin()\n\n# explains ethos part 1\nSteve_Miller.thoughts_on_hurting_someone()\n\n# use traits \nSteve_Miller.joke()\nSteve_Miller.smoke()\nSteve_Miller.midnight_toke()\n\n# explain ethos part 2\nSteve_Miller.how_loving_is_obtained()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nI'm a picker...\nI'm a grinner...\nI'm a lover...\nI'm a sinner.\nI don't want to hurt no one.\nI'm a joker...\nI'm a smoker...\nI'm a midnight toker.\nI get my loving on the run.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
