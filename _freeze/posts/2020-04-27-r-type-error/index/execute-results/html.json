Essentially it was a combination of a bugged error message in a package I was using, a bad row in an input file I was given, and some weird behavior of R (and of course, my initial carelessness in not noticing sooner). I caught this issues with some included QC functions.\n\nIt seemed plausible that these issues could join forces to trip people up now and then, so I figured I would document it in case people wanted to keep an eye out for it.\n\nIf you're not interested in this sort of analysis but use R, there is still a short takeaway summarized here:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(x <- c(\"1\", \"10\", \"100\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"1\"   \"10\"  \"100\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(x <- as.factor(x))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1   10  100\nLevels: 1 10 100\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(x <- as.integer(x))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1 2 3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhoops! Those numbers have been totally changed.\n\nThe repo for the analysis [here](https://github.com/sweeney-th/type-issue-case-study), and the PDF is below:\n\n<a class=\"s_pdf_download_link\" href=\"http://pythoninthewyld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CaseStudy.pdf\" download><button style=\"\" class=\"s_pdf_download_bttn\">Download</button></a>\n\n> NOTE: It appears more recent versions of DESeq2 don't do this!\n\n> NOTE: Edited for clarity, 2022-12-13",
