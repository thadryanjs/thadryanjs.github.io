>UPDATE: One of the articles misused in the piece has been [retracted](https://twitter.com/ThadryanJS/status/1280520204414603269?s=20), with the authors calling out Mac Donald by name as misusing their work.

>UPDATE (07/11/2020): The mysterious quote has been found and unleashed a new error. Brief rundown [here](https://sweeney-th.github.io/blog/2020/07/11/FactCheckHMDQuote), details to follow. 

A recent op-ed that ran in the Wall Street Journal contains numerous severe statistical and journalistic errors and makes an enormous claim which is fails to defend. I've created a YouTube video showing my research, explaining the errors, and placing them in context.


1) The piece relies heavily on research about police shootings *specifically* to make claims about police *generally*.
    This ignores literally every other way police can use force. 


2) The piece cites a study which prompted two follow-up papers that found errors and contradictory results,
    and in parts actually contradicts the claim the author is trying to make anyway.


3) The piece also cites well-known research out of context which actually contradicts their claim when taken in context


4) The author appears to fabricate a quote to make the piece sound more definitive (or something).
