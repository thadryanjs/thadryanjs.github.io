In a recent [Op-ed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883) Heather Mac Donald presents the following quote:

> "no significant evidence of antiblack disparity in the likelihood of being fatally shot by police"

This quote does not appear in [Johnson et al](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877).

The quote comes from a pre-print (before peer review) reply to a letter criticizing the methodology.

Reading the [pre-print](https://psyarxiv.com/dmhpu/) and the [published](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1264) version reveals the quote appears in the pre-print (uploaded August 16, 2019) but not in the published literature (published, January, 21, 2020).
