One example is our  Bayesian COVID Diagnostics app. This serves to complement our  manuscript  on lateral flow assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as providing the user with an easy-to-use tool to avoid the pitfalls of black-and-white thinking about diagnostics and counter-intuitive conditional probability. Another is  ContrApption, which is a JavaScript-powered R package that allows to user to create an interactive widget for exploring the results of differential expression experiments or any dataset with similar structure.\n\n\nStatistics for biomarkers\nI work on statistical analysis for biomarkers of potential use in Alzheimer‚Äôs Dementia and Neurological symptoms of COVID-19. We‚Äôve got two manuscripts submitted and a few more nearing completion in the sphere, so stay tuned and see my CV for the titles if you‚Äôre curious.\n\n\nStatistics and genomics for basic science\nFor an example of this, check out our  manuscript  on stress-dependent signatures of cellular and extracellular tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs). We‚Äôre interested in this from a basic science perspective as well as a potential avenue of biomarkers for diseases.\n\n\n‚ÄúHacktivism‚Äù\nI had the privilege of contributing to a  web tool  that allows users to interact with a dataset that ranks the states in the US based on how well they support the financial well-being of survivors of domestic abuse. I did this as a member of  RagTag  in support of  FREEFROM."

    "text": "The peanut-butter and jelly of paired data: zip() and dict()\nPaired data in Python is user-friendly and efficient, and I find myself using it all the time. Sometimes in the course of a workflow, we end up with with multiple simple lists of information that would be easier managed as paired data. If you find yourself in this situation, there are two simple tools that work in a really intuitive way to ‚Äúzip‚Äù the lists together such that the first item of list A is paired with the first item of list B. If the lists were [‚ÄúBruce‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeter‚Äù] and [‚ÄúWayne‚Äù, ‚ÄúPaker‚Äù] the out put would match them to {‚ÄúBruce‚Äù:‚ÄùWayne‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeter‚Äù:‚ÄùParker‚Äù}. *note that Python will also accept {‚ÄúMiles‚Äù:‚ÄùMorales‚Äù} üôÇ\nLet‚Äôs say we have two lists of names and want to store them as paired data in a dictionary. All we need to do to get a nice, tidy, dictionary out of it is the following (I‚Äôll show the running code and then go through it afterwards with a more realistic use case).\n\n# here are our two lists\nfirst = [\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"]\nsecond = [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]\n\n# make a dict from the output of zipping the two iterables\nthird = dict(zip(first, second))\n\n# iterate thorough and show we got what we were looking for\nfor item in third:\n    print(item, third[item])\n\nA 1\nB 2\nC 3\n\n\nThat‚Äôs it. What‚Äôs going on here? Let‚Äôs take a closer look.\nPython has a ‚Äúzip‚Äù function that will return a zip object of tuples (don‚Äôt worry if that sounds weird; it just means it is a zip class and has our data stored in a way such that it can‚Äôt be modified). It takes iteratable objects like lists as arguments, in our case, just two. It goes through the lists in order, and ‚Äúzips‚Äù them together, first item to first item, second to second, and so on.\n\n# here are our to lists\nfirst = [\"Christopher\",\"Jo-Vaughn\",\"Sean\",\"Sir Robert Bryson\"]\nlast = [\"Wallace\",\"Scott\",\"Carter\",\"Hall II\"]\n\n# call the zip function that takes iteratable structure \nnames = zip(first, last)\n\n# if we print it out, we see we have a zip object and memory address\nprint(names)\nprint(type(names))\n\n<zip object at 0x7fe250357300>\n<class 'zip'>\n\n\nWhile they are in the object, we can‚Äôt use them as paired data directly. Fortunately, the dict() function will take a list of tuples and return a dictionary.\n\n# use the dict function on the zip object\nnames = dict(names)\n\n# print out the evidence\nfor item in names:\n    print(item, names[item])\n\nChristopher Wallace\nJo-Vaughn Scott\nSean Carter\nSir Robert Bryson Hall II\n\n\nNote that this will also work with ints and floats. That‚Äôs all there is to it. Thanks for reading."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Simple Date Strings Conversion: split-process-join¬∂\nSomeone recently asked me about converting dates in number form to dates their names to make approximate ranges that are easier to read. For example, ‚Äú01/01/2017 to 04/01/2017‚Äù would be ‚ÄúJanuary to February‚Äù (in the context of what I was being asked, the years were the columns in a dataframe, so I wasn‚Äôt concerned with the year.\nFirstly, when confronted with this type of challenge, it is best to do a little background reading. If the times are in a certain format, for instance, there might be packages that allow you to manipulate and convert them already written, like Python‚Äôs datetime module. For this post, we will just assume we have raw strings and have to deal with them.\nThat said, let‚Äôs see what we are dealing with.\n\ndate = \"01/01/2017 to 04/01/2017\"\n\nNote that the information is all in one string, as opposed to a list with the dates in their own entries.\nThe first thing that might come to mind is a regular expression. They‚Äôre a powerful tool, and they might be useful in a problem like this. I ended finding a way to it without them. In general, I try to avoid them for simple tasks because trying to add a regex to a program is like busting out your pepper spray in a mosh pit. Quick, easy, life saver? Spark that turns a dicey situation into a full-on incident? Well-intended plan that backfires causing hours of pain? You just don‚Äôt know.\nI used a ‚Äúsplit-process-join‚Äù approach.\nIn order to simplify the process, I split the string on ‚Äù to ‚Äù so we can deal with each date on its own.\n\n# use the split function \nsplit_date = date.split(\" to \")\n\nprint(split_date)\n\n['01/01/2017', '04/01/2017']\n\n\nNow we an iterate over the list and use the .startswith() with method as this is a list of strings. I use the the range() function instead of ‚Äúfor x in y‚Äù because we want to refer to list elements by their number.\n\n# for each index in length of list...\nfor i in range(len(split_date)):\n    \n    # give it a name to for readability\n    entry = split_date[i]\n    \n    # if the entry there starts with \"01/\" -> \"January\"\n    if entry.startswith(\"01/\"):\n        \n        # replace the item in the array with the month\n        split_date[i] = \"January\"\n        \n    # as above with \"February\"\n    if entry.startswith(\"04/\"):\n       \n        # put \"February\" there\n        split_date[i] = \"February\"\n        \n# see the output \nprint(split_date)\n\n['January', 'February']\n\n\nTo finish the process, we simply need to join the entries back on the ‚Äù to ‚Äú. Because .split() and .join() and string methods in Python, the join is admittedly awkward looking.\n\n# on \" to \" join split_date\nfinal = \" to \".join(split_date)\n\n# show results \nprint(final)\n\nJanuary to February\n\n\nAnd we‚Äôre there:) All in once place, and from the top, that gives us:\n\ndate = \"01/01/2017 to 04/01/2017\"\n\nsplit_date = date.split(\" to \")\n\nfor i in range(len(split_date)):\n    entry = split_date[i]\n    if entry.startswith(\"01/\"):\n        split_date[i] = \"January\"\n    if entry.startswith(\"04/\"):\n        split_date[i] = \"February\"\n\nfinal = \" to \".join(split_date)\n\nprint(final)\n\nJanuary to February\n\n\nObviously, this is just a proof of concept that only works for two months, but it is easy to see how it could made into a function. What would your next step be? I‚Äôd go with a function using a dict.\n\ndef number_to_name(date):\n    # create a dic that stores the pairs\n    d = {\"01/\":\"January\",  \"02/\":\"February\", \"03/\":\"March\", \n         \"04/\":\"April\"  ,  \"05/\":\"May\",      \"06/\":\"June\",\n         \"07/\":\"July\",     \"08/\":\"August\",   \"09/\":\"September\",\n         \"10/\":\"October\",  \"11/\":\"November\", \"12/\":\"December\" }\n    \n    split_date = date.split(\" to \")\n    for i in range(len(split_date)):\n        entry = split_date[i]\n        # the first 3 chars denote the month\n        month = entry[:3]\n        # sub them from dict\n        split_date[i] = d[month]\n    # return after joining \n    return \" to \".join(split_date)               # ugly, but saves a line\n                                         \nprint(number_to_name(\"01/01/2017 to 04/01/2017\"))\n\nJanuary to April\n\n\nIt might make sense to define the dict outside the function so it doesn‚Äôt recreate it every time in practice. Feel free to take this and do whatever to it, and I am open to hearing how people would improve it."

We can‚Äôt replace something will the right pair in the dict if the item isn‚Äôt in the dict, and, if you think about it, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to do if we iterate over every letter and look it up in the dict regardless of whether or not it‚Äôs there.\nNote: I‚Äôm going to comment every line on this one to make sure we‚Äôre on the same page as this function will serve as the basis of all the ones coming after it.

It seems we have a variation. We assumed all the problematic strings were ‚ÄúABC‚Äùs, but one is just a ‚ÄúC‚Äù. No problem, right? We just update the dictionary to get rid of ‚ÄúC‚Äù as well. Not quite. Here is the thing that goes wrong with these types of functions: we don‚Äôt know what order the substitutions are happening in. So we might remove the ‚ÄúC‚Äù from ‚ÄúABC‚Äù (leaving it as just ‚ÄúAB‚Äù) first thing, then when we look for ‚ÄúABC‚Äùs to sub, there wont be any. Our program would end without doing anything, and we would still have the ‚ÄúAB‚Äù.\nFor another example, imagine we are replacing ‚ÄúHello‚Äù with 1, and ‚ÄúHe‚Äù with 2. Our string could be ‚ÄúHe Said Hello‚Äù. If ‚ÄúHe‚Äù gets changed first, we would have ‚Äú2 Said 2llo‚Äù. When we go to look for hello? There is no hello."

    "text": "So what do we do?\nMy solution for this problem is to make sure we iterate through the dictionary keys from LARGEST by length to SMALLEST by length to ensure that we don‚Äôt replace any pieces of them by accident. Using the He/Hello example, we substitute the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù first so none of the substrings (‚ÄúHe‚Äù) can interfere. We can do this by using the sorted() function and using the reverse = True options (it goes smallest to largest by default). Check it.\n\ns = \"HEREABCISABCACSAMPLEABCSTRING\"\n\nd ={\"C\":\"-\", \"ABC\":\"-\"}\n\ndef find_replace_multi_ordered(string, dictionary):\n    # sort keys by length, in reverse order\n    for item in sorted(dictionary.keys(), key = len, reverse = True):\n        string = re.sub(item, dictionary[item], string)\n    return string\n\nfind_replace_multi_ordered(s, d)\n\n'HERE-IS-A-SAMPLE-STRING'\n\n\nLooks as if we are on the right track. Because we replaced the biggest strings first (‚ÄúABC‚Äù), and the the smallest (‚ÄúC‚Äù), we ensure the ‚ÄúC‚Äù in ‚ÄúABC‚Äù didn‚Äôt get messed with. I‚Äôll write one more test to be sure. To confirm that the largest is going first, and not simply that ‚ÄúABC‚Äù is going before ‚ÄúC‚Äù, we‚Äôll add another value to the dict (the rest of the code stays the same). I‚Äôll use ‚ÄúCSAMPLEABC‚Äù, because the only way for that to be replaced is if it goes before ‚ÄúC‚Äù and ‚ÄúABC‚Äù as BOTH of those strings are in it.\n\ns = \"HEREABCISABCACSAMPLEABCSTRING\"\n\nd ={\"C\":\"-\", \"ABC\":\"-\", \"CSAMPLEABC\":\"-:)-\"}\n\ndef find_replace_multi_ordered(string, dictionary):\n    # sort keys by length, in reverse order\n    for item in sorted(dictionary.keys(), key = len, reverse = True):\n        string = re.sub(item, dictionary[item], string)\n    return string\n\nfind_replace_multi_ordered(s, d)\n\n'HERE-IS-A-:)-STRING'\n\n\nAnd there we have it! Our final function. It‚Äôs worth noting that, while I made the initial character-character find-and-replace function to work us up to this one, we final function will work for simple character-character substitutions too, so we only need the one, final version for all the tasks here. I‚Äôd advise doing so because it has error avoidance with the iteration and the ‚Äúif‚Äù statement."

    "text": "Scala is a JVM language that seeks to marry functional and object-oriented programming styles. It was was Designed by Martin Odersky and first appeared in 2004. While I think many projects that aspire to ‚Äúbest of both worlds‚Äù status end up ugly and chimeric, my explorations with Scala have revealed a really thoughtful and lovely creation that elegantly merges different paradigms. While it isn‚Äôt one of the top-tier languages for for production code job hunting (think Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc), it made the GitHub top 15 list for most common languages recently. I suspect much of this is because it‚Äôs becoming popular as a language for data science as a happy medium language between the breezy-to-write-but-relatively-slow Python and the incumbent production veteran Java that is faster but comes with a notoriously verbose syntax (still very much worth learning though!). Scala aims to be approachable and quick to develop as well as fast (some tests show it performing at Java speed or better), thus avoiding the need to ‚Äúproductionize‚Äù slower, exploratory code if a project grows (The name ‚ÄúScala‚Äù is a shortening of the ‚ÄúScalable Language‚Äù, after all). Nobody is going to be putting Java out of business any time soon (just ask the flashier start-up favorite Ruby, but Scala joins Python, Java, and R as a helpful tool for data and general purpose coding. After spending a good amount of time with the Scala home page, ‚ÄúScala for the Impatient‚Äùby Cay S. Horstmann, and Bruce Eckel‚Äôs classic ‚ÄúThinking in Java‚Äù, I opted to create an overview for my own edification and for some people I know who are newcomers to the language. Happy Hacking.\nIn Scala, a program takes place in a ‚Äúsingleton object‚Äù. This is an object of which only one iteration can exist. This is slightly different than Java, where it would be written as ‚Äúclass helloWorld {‚Äù.\nNext we see a ‚Äúmain‚Äù method defined like in Java. Also like Java, this function takes an Array of Strings as an argument ( args: Array[String]) ). The more unusual part is ‚ÄúUnit‚Äù. This is the Scala‚Äôs version of ‚Äúvoid‚Äù, which means that the function doesn‚Äôt return anything (it just executes the code inside it).\nAfter that, there is a println() call that will look familiar to Java coders that prints the message.\nBecause we are using a notebook, we can write snippets of code outside an object like this, but keep in mind if we were writing a program in a more typical format it would need to be inside that object.\nFrom now on, we can just write:"

    "section": "Object Oriented Programming",
    "text": "Object Oriented Programming\nWe‚Äôve mostly seen simple imperative programming and hints of Scala‚Äôs functional origin but it also an Object Oriented language.\n\nCase Classes\nThe most simple version of OO Scala is the case class. While a bit foreign to Java folks, they are quite handy. Case classes are generally small, simple, immutable structures, like points on a graph. Let‚Äôs define one:\n\n// define a case class with an x and y value \ncase class Point(x:Int, y:Int)\n\n\ndefined class Point\n\n\n\nThat‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs disarmingly simple compared to a Java object, but it works. Part of this is because it assumes that you want immutable fields unless otherwise specified (part of the functional meets OO approach). Creating one is straightforward and largely familiar to Java folks:\n\n// make a new Point\nval myLocation = new Point(1,2)\n\n// access the members\nmyLocation.x\nmyLocation.y\n\n//// can't do this:\n// myLocation.x = 5\n//// unless it was defined like this, specifying they could vary\n// case class Point(var x:Int, var y:Int)\n\n\nmyLocation: Point = Point(1, 2)\nres84_1: Int = 1\nres84_2: Int = 2\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Classes\nWe will make a simple Person class that has a private value (available only to the class) to represent its age and a String for a name. We will include methods for it to get older and to display the current age. Classes are public by default.\n\n// define a class\nclass Person {\n    // set a field\n    private var age = 0\n    var name = \"\"\n    \n    // method to increase age\n    def getOlder { age += 1 }\n    \n    // method to say age\n    def sayAge { println(age) }\n}\n\n// make a new instance \nval rando = new Person\n\n// show age before and after method call \nrando.sayAge\nrando.getOlder\nrando.sayAge\n\n// give the person a name \nrando.name = \"Abakus\"\nprintln(rando.name)\n\n0\n1\nAbakus\n\n\n\ndefined class Person\nrando: Person = ammonite.$sess.cmd85$Helper$Person@6162ffa6\n\n\n\nWhat if we wanted to make mandatory fields? We can include them in the parenthesis in a move that will look familiar to Python coders.\n\n// define a person with a name and an age\nclass Person(val name: String, var age: Int)\n\n//// this would crash \"not enough arguments for constructor\":\n//> val kanye = new Person(name = \"Kanye\")\n///...because it doesn't have the arguments that we told it were needed.\n\n// make a new instance of the class named kanye\nval kanye = new Person(name = \"Kanye\", age = 35)\n\n// show values \nkanye.name\nkanye.age\n\n\ndefined class Person\nkanye: Person = ammonite.$sess.cmd86$Helper$Person@360cbb22\nres86_2: String = \"Kanye\"\nres86_3: Int = 35\n\n\n\n\nConstructors\nConstructors allow the writer to dictate behavior that takes place whenever an instance of the class is created (for the uninitiated, the footnotes of this page contain a brief explanation). It‚Äôs common, for instance, for an object that reads a file to do so upon to construction. This saves the time of creating the object and then calling a method to have it read the file. In C++ and Java, the constructor is a method of the class that has the same name as the class. In Scala however, it just executes the code immediately inside the class definition. Let‚Äôs take a look at a simple example:\n\nclass TinyHuman {\n    // this is constructor behavior\n    println(\"I have been born and am alive!\")\n}\n\n// this will print it's greeting even thought we didn't call anything\nval newborn = new TinyHuman\n\nI have been born and am alive!\n\n\n\ndefined class TinyHuman\nnewborn: TinyHuman = ammonite.$sess.cmd87$Helper$TinyHuman@7e1bdf48\n\n\n\n\n\nGetters and Setters\nGetters and Setters are built into classes by Scala (for the unfamiliar, the footnotes of this page contain a brief explanation). While this might seem wild, the programmer can control them using ‚Äúvar‚Äù, ‚Äúval‚Äù, and the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù keyword to restrict how they are used, allowing full control of the class. The auto-generator methods are ‚Äúfoo‚Äù and ‚Äúfoo_‚Äù in the Java Virtual Machine code made by compiling Scala.\n\nclass Year {\n    var month = 1 // starts in Jan \n}\n\nval thisYear = new Year()\nthisYear.month            // this will call the internal \"foo\", in this case, \"month\"\nthisYear.month = 2        // this calls the \"foo_\", in this case \"month_\"\n\n\ndefined class Year\nthisYear: Year = ammonite.$sess.cmd88$Helper$Year@182a8837\nres88_2: Int = 1\n\n\n\nScala will also allow you to define ‚Äúfoo‚Äù and ‚Äúfoo_‚Äù yourself if you want to (or just foo).\nTo make Scala write only a getter method declare that value with ‚Äúval‚Äù. Because vals cannot change, it will not bother with setter method.\nTo make Scala create a getter and a setter, declare an attribute with ‚Äúvar‚Äù - an attribute that can change will require a getter and a setter.\n\n\nPrivate Attributes\nPrivate attributes work in a Java-like way. Here, we use private to make an attribute that can be incremented by the user but not set to whatever they want as they can‚Äôt access it directly:\n\nclass Year {\n    private var month = 1\n    def incrementMonth { month += 1 }\n    def showCurrentMonth = println(month)\n}\n\nval now = new Year\n\nnow.incrementMonth\nnow.showCurrentMonth\n\n2\n\n\n\ndefined class Year\nnow: Year = ammonite.$sess.cmd89$Helper$Year@33d58403\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructors\nScala generates a standard constructor for all the classes you define.\nWe can do so using what Scala calls a ‚ÄúPrimary Constructor‚Äù. This is like a constructor in other languages except that is is implicitly created as part of the class definition.\n\nclass Child {\n    println(\"I am alive!\")\n    println(\"I have a constructor and it is the best!\")\n}\n\n// the message will just occur\nval kiddie = new Child\n\nI am alive!\nI have a constructor and it is the best!\n\n\n\ndefined class Child\nkiddie: Child = ammonite.$sess.cmd90$Helper$Child@965084a\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritance\nScala provides a predictable means of single inheritance (Like Java, Scala does not implement multiple inheritance).\n\n// class and method definition in a single line?\nclass Kid { def talk(): Unit = { println(\"I say the damnest things\") }}\n\nclass PreTeen extends Kid{}\n\n// will automatically have the method from Kid even though it is a preteen\nval newKid = new PreTeen\n\nnewKid.talk\n\nI say the damnest things\n\n\n\ndefined class Kid\ndefined class PreTeen\nnewKid: PreTeen = ammonite.$sess.cmd91$Helper$PreTeen@a4d13c1\n\n\n\nJava coders: note that Scala constructors do not require the use of super(), though the languages does support it for access superclass methods in general and it is used the same way as in Java.\n\n\nComposition\nScala offers ‚Äúmixins‚Äù for composing classes based on functionality.\n\n// define a lover that loves\ntrait lover {\n  def love(): Unit = {\n    println(\"I am a lover!\")\n  }\n}\n\n// define a fighter that fights \ntrait fighter {\n  def fight(): Unit = {\n    println(\"I am a fighter!\")\n  }\n}\n\n// mix them together to make a rouge \nclass rouge(name: String) extends lover with fighter {\n  // the rouge can call both of methods from the mixins\n  def enGarde(): Unit = {\n    love\n    fight\n    println(\"I am \" + name + \"!\")\n  }\n}\n\nval zoro = new rouge(\"Zoro\")            // make a new rouge\nzoro.enGarde                            // put foes on notice!\n\nI am a lover!\nI am a fighter!\nI am Zoro!\n\n\n\ndefined trait lover\ndefined trait fighter\ndefined class rouge\nzoro: rouge = ammonite.$sess.cmd92$Helper$rouge@22a12e9e\n\n\n\n\n\nOverriding a method\nScala supports the ‚Äúoverride‚Äù keyword to specify a new method behavior. Let‚Äôs make a subspecies of Rouge with his own enGarde() protocol:\n\nclass revengeSeeker(name: String, warning: String) extends rouge(name) {\n  // override the definition of enGarge\n  override def enGarde(): Unit = {                                        \n    love \n    fight\n    println(\"I am \" + name + \" \" + warning)\n  }\n}\n\nval inigo = new revengeSeeker(name = \"Inigo Montoya\", warning = \"Prepare to die!\")\ninigo.enGarde\n\nI am a lover!\nI am a fighter!\nI am Inigo Montoya Prepare to die!\n\n\n\ndefined class revengeSeeker\ninigo: revengeSeeker = ammonite.$sess.cmd93$Helper$revengeSeeker@4b5258dc"

    "text": "Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\nOOP is often considered a little weird to learn, but becomes very intuitive with some practice because it is used to model real things. It‚Äôs used to imitate things from the real world and store data in the same way they do.\nA ‚Äúclass‚Äù is a model or blueprint for how to store that information. You might have a class to imitate ‚ÄúStudents‚Äù. Each INDIVIDUAL occurrence of a class is called and ‚Äúobject‚Äù. If there was a class called ‚ÄúStudent‚Äù, you and I were students, we would be individual objects of the type ‚ÄúStudent‚Äù. In Python code this looks like this:\n\n# class \"Student\" is an object\nclass Student(object):\n    # def is Python's version of sub - we're making a function acting on self                 \n    def say_what_you_are(self):          \n        # print out a message \n        print(\"I am a student\")"

We just told it HOW to do so. It‚Äôs the blueprint NOT a building.\nNow let‚Äôs make an individual object:\n\nJiaojiao = Student() # Python doesn't require you to say new\n\nThat‚Äôs it. Notice that there is no output. She‚Äôs just sitting there. That‚Äôs ok. We told her to be born as a student, we didn‚Äôt tell her to do anything. Unless otherwise specified, an object will just sit there, existing. Let‚Äôs make her do something:\n\nJiaojiao.say_what_you_are()    # the \".\" notation is used to \"call\" things out of or from an object. \n\nI am a student\n\n\nThat‚Äôs all this student class can do. Not very interesting. We will write over thr first definition with a better one. Let‚Äôs add an attribute:\n\nclass Student(object):\n    # we've added an attribute \"name\", that starts blank\n    name = \"\" \n    def say_what_you_are(self):\n        print(\"I am a student\")\n\nNow ‚ÄúStudent‚Äùs have a name, set to nothing by default. Let‚Äôs see how we would use that:\n\n# create Ashmi \nAshmi = Student()         \n\n# Will print an empty string. Not helpful!\nprint(Ashmi.name)         \n\n# give her a name, because it starts as nothing. No (), because its not a function/method\nAshmi.name = \"Ashmmi\"    \n\n# we can print her name now\nprint(Ashmi.name)         \n\n\nAshmmi\n\n\nLet‚Äôs make the class more usefull by adding an introduce itself. This requires us to understand ‚Äúself‚Äù more. ‚Äúself‚Äù is to explicity tell the object what to do and let it know it‚Äôs talking about itself. It‚Äôs as if you pass it to itself so it can do things to itself, like how Perl has ‚Äú$self = shift‚Äù. It‚Äôs ‚Äúself‚Äù aware, in that it can get to it‚Äôs attibutes. This is a really powerful idea becaues it allows us to direct lots of objects with making each one.\n\nclass Student(object):\n\n    name = \"\"\n    \n    # let it know who it will be talking about.\n    def say_what_you_are(self):    \n        print(\"I am a student\")\n\n    # acces the name of self\n    def introduce_yourself(self):         \n        print(\"Hello, I am\", self.name)   \n\nHere is how we can use this and the objects will say their specific name.\n\nNareh = Student()\nNareh.name = \"Nareh\"\n\nAshmi = Student()\nAshmi.name = \"Ashmi\"\n\n# they will give their names with the same method call\nNareh.introduce_yourself()     \nAshmi.introduce_yourself()\n\nHello, I am Nareh\nHello, I am Ashmi"

In Python it‚Äôs called ‚Äúinit‚Äù to differentiate it form other functions. We will add one.

For our purposes, We can make each ‚Äútrait‚Äù into it‚Äôs own class and pick only what we want.\n\n### here is a \"trait\"\nclass GradStudent(object):\n    # a class of a grad student that will be the GradStudent \"trait\"\n    def do_things(self):\n        print(\"I study!\")\n        \n### here is the other \nclass Complainer(object):         \n    # a class of a complainer that will be the complainer \"trait\"\n    def complain_about_undergrads(self):\n        print(\"Seriously, they are the WORST\")\n\nLet‚Äôs mix and match! We‚Äôll make a class the has one trait, and another that has both.\n\n### a class \"composed\" of one trait\nclass PhdStudent(GradStudent):  \n    # PhdStudents are GradStudents - we add \"mix in\" one trait to make the class\n    def say_hi(self):    \n        print(\"I am a PhD student. I can't kvetch about undergrads. That makes no sense.\")\n        \n### a class \"composed\" of two traits - GradStudent and Complainer  \nclass MastersStudent(GradStudent, Complainer): \n    # Masters Students are GradStudents AND Complainers\n    # # we wix in two traits to make the class\n    def say_hi(self):\n        \n        print(\"I am a MS student, I CAN kvetch about undergrads. Watch:\")\n\n\n# make a MastersStudent\nus = MastersStudent()            \n# use their traits \nus.say_hi()                      \nus.complain_about_undergrads()\n\nI am a MS student, I CAN kvetch about undergrads. Watch:\nSeriously, they are the WORST\n\n\n\n# make a PhdStudent\nthem = PhdStudent()               \n# will work\nthem.say_hi()\n# will not if uncommented - didn't get composed with complain_about_undergrads()\n# them.complain_about_undergrads() \n\nI am a PhD student. I can't kvetch about undergrads. That makes no sense.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs a little abstract in theory, but very useful in practice. It‚Äôs where design comes in - it‚Äôs not always clear which is best, or both might be just fine. Gotta tinker. It‚Äôs just odd because it requires to look at coding in abstraction not just technique. For more examples, imagine you were modeling the characters in a story. I might make three traits:\nLover\nFighter\nAsshole\nThe Hero of the story could be a Lover + Fighter. The Villian of the story would be a Fighter + Asshole. That way you could keep a trait from going where you don‚Äôt want it. A less abstract example would be in something like our final. You could make traits like:\nReader\nWriter\nGenerator\nDisplayer\nObjects that read in sequence data and made new subseq objects might have the traits ‚ÄúReader‚Äù and ‚ÄúGenerator‚Äù, and have the _getGenbankSeqs method. The ones that wrote new fasta files might be ‚ÄúWriter‚Äù and have writeFasta. You could add ‚ÄúDisplayer‚Äù to whatever one you wanted to see terminal output from (it would probably have printResults)."

    "text": "Maybe you want something a little more purpose-built than Bash to mine some text and need a refresher. Perhaps you‚Äôre in Bioinformatics and want to extract some patterns from DNA (the original weird programming language). Maybe the eccentric, neck-bearded, regex-wizard in your office just retired and you‚Äôve inherited a couple of scripts. Whatever the reason, you need to get¬†(re)acquainted with Perl. I‚Äôve got you covered with a slew of in-context examples of working code.\nPerl was originally developed in 1987 (just like yours, truly) by Larry Wall (unlike yours, truly). Before the language took off, he originally set out to automate the processing of text reports on Unix systems. Perl accordingly boasts a lot of support for text processing. Perl espouses the ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more than one way to do it‚Äù philosophy, often referred to as TMTOWTDI, (pronounced ‚ÄúTim Toady‚Äù), which favors flexibility over standardization (contrast with Python‚Äôs ‚ÄúThere should be one, obvious way to do it‚Äù). The benefits of this approach are intuitive: providing many ways to do things increases the chances that one will ‚Äúclick‚Äù for the user, and that the approach used with be just right for the specific task at hand (The drawbacks manifest in difficulty standardizing approaches). This perspective, along with a thriving on-line community & code repository¬† CPAN (which still exists), brought Perl a great deal of popularity. It simultaneously earned it a reputation as a ‚ÄúSwiss-army chainsaw‚Äù or, given its usage in the early days of the web (Perl predates Rails, and even Ruby itself), ‚Äúthe duct tape that holds the internet together‚Äù.\nPerl also established itself as an influential language in the trend toward high-level programing languages as the cost of programmers started to become more of a burden than the cost of machines. It‚Äôs cheaper to pay someone for a few hours of Perl than a few days of C if high-performance execution isn‚Äôt a factor, and machines speeding up pushed this calculus in Perl‚Äôs favor more and more often. When the Human Genome Project launched in 1990, formalizing the collision of Biology and Computer Science, Perl was the high level language of choice, with Python in its infancy and the whimsical Ruby not yet born. Perl excelled especially in searching for patterns in text, (how DNA is generally represented) helping the match stick. Continuing with the trend of ease-of-use, it‚Äôs also easier to convince a skeptical Biologist to put a ‚Äú$‚Äù in front of text and numbers than to, say, use pointers.\nPerl‚Äôs flexibility will allow you to make yourself a mess (it is, after all, a feature, not a bug according to it‚Äôs creator), but a competent programmer can make clean, robust systems with it (almost of as fast as a novice could make ugly, fragile ones in a cleaner language). You‚Äôll also have it at your disposal out-of-the-box on the majority us Unix based systems (including many Macs).\nIf you‚Äôre curious, you can check out the repository here."

    "title": "Closures in Python",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A closure is technique that allows functions to bundle variables in their local scope for access at a later time. If there was a variable x with the value of ten in the namespace for instance, even after that code executed, we could refer back to the namespace and x would still be 10. That‚Äôs a little dry; fortunately the idea is easier to illustrate in code using a function with a function inside it.\n\ndef add_ten_to_things():\n    # inside this function is a scope\n    # we'll call it \"outer scope\"\n    x = 10\n    def inner(y):\n        # this function has a scope\n        # we'll call it \"inner scope\"\n        return x + y\n    return inner\n\nNotice how in the inner function we refer to the outer scope (to the variable x) and then return the inner scope? This is the mechanism that allows closures to work: that x is now packaged into the returned inner(). Let‚Äôs see how it can be accessed:\n\n# we call the original add_ten_to_things() function that returns the inner function/namespace\nadd_ten = add_ten_to_things()\n\n# we pass something for \"y\" and it will still be able to add 10 to it\nprint(add_ten(20))\n\n30\n\n\nBecause 10 is stored in the local namespace of the outer function that produces the new function, 10 can still be accessed by it. A function that makes functions that add ten to things isn‚Äôt especially useful, however:\n\ndef add_x_to_things(x):\n    def adder(y):\n        return x + y\n    return adder\n\nincrease_by_five = add_x_to_things(5)\nincrease_by_ten = add_x_to_things(10)\n\none_plus_five = increase_by_five(1)\none_plus_ten = increase_by_ten(6)\n\nprint(one_plus_five, one_plus_ten)\n\n6 16\n\n\nYou‚Äôd be forgiven for wondering what the point of that would be. It makes more sense once you realize you can pass arguments to the outer function and that they will be accessible to the inner one. To illustrate, consider the following example, where a function can make several types of greeter builders depending on what is passed to the outer function.\n\n# the outer function\ndef greeter_maker(greeting):\n    # inner function\n    def greeter(name):\n        print(greeting + \",\", name)\n    # outer function returns the inner \n    return greeter\n\n\nformal_greeter = greeter_maker(\"Hello, pleased to meet you\")\ncasual_greeter = greeter_maker(\"Heyo\")\n\nIn action:\n\ncasual_greeter(\"Josh\")\nformal_greeter(\"Sruthi\")\n\nHeyo, Josh\nHello, pleased to meet you, Sruthi\n\n\nAnother builder:\nWhile this show some flexibility that could be made into something useful, it can be hard to see just what a powerful idea this idea is without some context, so we will look at one more example. Consider the following class:\n\nclass Person(object):\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\nThis is an extremely simple Python class that models a Person with a name and age. It‚Äôs probably obvious to any hypothetical user of this class that ‚Äúname‚Äù is a string and ‚Äúage‚Äô is an integer (or at least a number or some kind). However, as Python is dynamically typed, there is nothing in the language itself to enforce this. Consider the following:\n\n# everything goes according to plan...\nchristian = Person(\"Christian Slater\", 49)\n\n# whoops, wrong order...\nrami = Person(37, \"Rami Malek\")\n\n# gets nane \nprint(christian.name)\n# not what we though we'd get\nprint(rami.name)\n\nChristian Slater\n37\n\n\nThis program will run just fine until sometime downstream when someone tries to do a computation a involving rami‚Äôs name or age but has the wrong type of data (ie, age += 1 and finds it‚Äôs a string). Consider the following usage of a closure to prevent this (this is much simpler than it seems once you see it in context so hang on):\n\n# takes a dictionary of attributes->types, and a model\ndef typechecking_builder(required_params, model):\n    \n    def _builder(attributes_passed):\n        # iterate through the dict that was passed to the outer function\n        for k in attributes_passed.keys():\n            current_param = attributes_passed[k]\n            type_required = required_params[k]\n            # ensure they're what we've been told to expect\n            try:\n                assert type(current_param) == type_required\n                print(\"Type check passed for\", current_param, \"of type\", type_required)\n            # raise an error if they're not\n            except AssertionError:\n                print(\"\\tfound\", current_param, \"of type\", type(current_param), \"Required:\", type_required)\n                raise TypeError(\"Type check failed for:\", k) # whatever you want to do for exception handling\n    # return the type checking function\n    return _builder\n\nWe can now make a builder that will type check for us, telling the function what it should expect when it is called:\n\n# make people, thier name is a string, thier age is an int, they're of type Person\nperson_builder = typechecking_builder({\"name\": str, \"age\":int}, Person)\n\nWhen we use this, it will check the types we passed:\n\ncarly = person_builder({\"name\": \"Carly Chaikin\", \"age\": 28})\n\nType check passed for Carly Chaikin of type <class 'str'>\nType check passed for 28 of type <class 'int'>\n\n\nNow, if we make the simple mistake from before, we get feedback right away:\n\nsunita = person_builder({\"name\": 32, \"age\": \"Sunita Mani\"})\n\n    found 32 of type <class 'int'> Required: <class 'str'>\n\n\nTypeError: ('Type check failed for:', 'name')\n\n\n‚Ä¶and every Person we build will be type checked!"

    "title": "How to install Arch Linux on a VirtualBox VM",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There have been several walkthroughs on installing Arch Linux on VMs, like this one for example. However, I noticed there have been some changes that call for a few updates, so I thought I‚Äôd post a procedure that included them. As of the date of this post, this guide will produce a working system from the ground up. I also added some tweaks to get the most out of the VM, creating and adding users, and installing a desktop environment.\n\n\nTL;DNR: Arch is great is you want a well-documented, minimal system that you can customize, has up-to-date software, and will teach you about Linux. It‚Äôs not great if you want something up and running quickly with out-of-the-box features or something that doesn‚Äôt update often.\nThe benefits and downsides or Arch have been debated extensively (ad nauseam?) all over the internet. This is my take on summarizing them in as briefly as possible while still giving a good enough overview that people can choose for themselves (this is purely from a practical standpoint and doesn‚Äôt get into more philosphical stuff like systemd).\n\n\n\nMinimal - Arch installs a minimal system without even so much as a desktop environment and not a lot of stuff to slow your system down. The user doesn‚Äôt have the hassle of tracking down extra software and figuring if it‚Äôs bloat or important.\n\n\nCustomizable - This minimal approach means you can install whatever you want. In particular, you get to choose a desktop without depending on that has been made into a flavor/edition/spin.\n\n\nWell-documented - The much-hyped Arch Wiki is, in fact, great.\n\n\nTransparent - It‚Äôs often said Arch is good if you want to learn more about GNU/Linux and how it works. Arch is helpful for this in my experience - I learned a lot tinkering under the hood.\n\n\nCurrent - Arch is a rolling release distro know for getting updates quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Relatively) Complex to install - Arch has a more involved installation process that other distros; the minimal system doesn‚Äôt come without a trade-off. It‚Äôs less geared to getting a system setup quickly and easily than other distros.\n\n\nRequires some maintenance - every now and then (a handful of times a year maybe) a package will requires you to manually run a command or two to update properly. They‚Äôll be noted on the front page of the Arch website, but if you let them build up, things can get weird. In theory, this increases the chances that some update will screw up your machine and require you too boot into a live medium and fix it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHead over to the Arch Linux download page and either torrent yourself an ISO or download one from one of the mirrors.\n\n\nVirtualBox can be downloaded here. For Windows/Mac people, select the installer from the list. When on Linux I prefer to go with my distro-specific package manager.\n\n\nThere are a few steps to the VM setup but they‚Äôre simple and the defaults will work in most cases. Once you‚Äôve got VirtualBox running, click ‚ÄúNew‚Äù to get things started.\n\nGive your machine a snappy name! VirtualBox will detect what system it is if it starts with ‚ÄúArch‚Äù. If it doesn‚Äôt, you can select it from the dropdown. Choose ‚ÄúArch Linux (64-bit)‚Äù.\n\nVBox will ask what you want for memory size. I usually double this just to make sure the machine isn‚Äôt sluggish, then click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù.\n\nWe want to create a disk, not load an existing one. Just click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù.\n\nWe can accept the default drive type and click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù.\n\nI use dynamically allocated by default, and it will work fine for our purposes.\n\nI put the size up to 24 GB in case we want to build out the system and try it for a daily driver for a while or something. It‚Äôs just a VM, so it‚Äôs no big deal!\n\nWe will now see the machine on the VBox menu on the left side of the screen.\n\nBefore we go ahead and start it and select our ISO, a few little tweaks make the VBox experience a lot more pleasant and fast. Click ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù. You‚Äôll see a menu like this:\n\nNavigate to ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù.\n\nChoose the ‚ÄúProcessor‚Äù tab, and increase the number of CPUs the VM is allowed to use (assuming you have more than one on the host machine). Then move over to ‚ÄúDisplay‚Äù on the menu on the left side of the screen.\n\nI like to increase the video to max as well. Exit the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù menu by clicking ‚ÄúOk‚Äù. We‚Äôre ready to fire up the machine and connect it to our Arch ISO. In the top menu click the green ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button.\n\nVBox will now ask you where your bootable media is. Click the folder icon. You‚Äôll see a screen like this:\n\nClick the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù symbol in the left of the menu, navigate to wherever you downloaded your ISO, and select it with ‚ÄúChoose‚Äù, then click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù.\n\nSelect the first option, which boots us into a live Arch system. When you boot in, a series of message will flash by and then you‚Äôll see something like this:\n\nNote: If the terminal seems cluttered, pressing ctl-l between commands will clear the screen. If the amount of black space on your screen looks different than mine it‚Äôs probably just that I‚Äôve done this.\nHere goes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where we prepare the hard drive for installation. There are many ways to do this, with separate partitions for boot, swap, etc, but for a simple test VM, we‚Äôre just going to install it all into one partition. We prepare it using the following command.\ncfdisk\nThis starts a partitioning tool. You‚Äôll be given an option to select ‚Äúlabel type‚Äù by moving the arrows up and down. We‚Äôre looking for dos.\n\nNext you will see a screen like the one below. You can move left and write with arrow keys to make a selection. Move to ‚ÄúNew‚Äù, and hit ‚Äúenter‚Äù to make a new partition of the virtual hard rive.\n\nHit enter to use all 24G.\n\nSelect ‚Äúprimary‚Äù when asked for type (extended partitions allow for sub-dividing space, which isn‚Äôt a concern since we‚Äôre using the whole virtual disk for one thing).\n\nNow move to the ‚ÄúBootable‚Äù option on the left side of the screen and hit enter.\n\nNavigate to ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù and hit enter to make these changes actually happen. If we were on a real machine, this would be the point of no return where we had erased the underlying system.\n\nYou will have to type ‚Äúyes‚Äù to consent to the operation. The top of the screen should show a partition of 24G on /dev/sda1 with a * under ‚ÄúBoot‚Äù.\n\nNow we can head over to ‚ÄúQuit‚Äù and exit the partition editor tool.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we assign the file system type to the newly partitioned drive partition. ext4 is the default file system for Linux.\nmkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1\n\nYou will see some output from the results of the command. Now we mount the drive so we can install the base system:\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n\n\nArch uses a utility called pacstrap utility to install the base Arch system. If you‚Äôre looking for an update, this is one place where things are different from previous tutorials. In previous versions only base and base-devel were needed here. Failing to include linux and linux-firmware will cause a failure to boot later on because this is the actual Linux kernel and associated content. This step will most likely take several minutes.\npacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware\nInitially, you‚Äôll see:\n\n‚Ä¶and then something like:\n\nThis is the normal display of Arch syncing and installing packages, the equivalent of the apt update, etc procedure in Debian based systems. Hit enter to continue when prompted.\nWhen it‚Äôs done, it will look like this:\n\nWe now need to create a file system table. This is a record of our hard drive partitions assigned identifiers for efficient look-up. If you‚Äôre curious, you can view the help for the command like this:\ngenfstab -h\n\nTo use it, and redirect the output to the proper spot on our system, use this command:\ngenfstab /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab\nNow we use the Arch version of chroot. This creates an isolated environment that doesn‚Äôt have access to the main system in case we biff something (the extra arguments are where to put this environment and what shell to use).\narch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash\nYou should notice a change in the terminal prompt:\n\nWe will install nano, and simple text-editor, within chroot so we can do some manual configuration. pacman is the package manager for Arch. It‚Äôs fast, simple, and dearly beloved. -S means ‚Äúsync‚Äù, as in ‚Äúsync these packages with my machine‚Äù. This is also a divergence from previous tutorials.\npacman -S nano\n\nHit enter to accept the default and proceed with the installation. This should be quick.\n\n\n\nNow we‚Äôre free to edit some files:\nnano /etc/locale.gen\n\nWe‚Äôre doing this setup for English language systems, use whatever you‚Äôre looking for. Basically we‚Äôre just un-commenting the language locale we want. If you‚Äôre configuring an English language system, scroll until you find‚Ä¶\n#en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8\n‚Ä¶and un-comment it.\n\nPress ctr-x to exit nano. You‚Äôll be asked if you want to save the modified buffer.\n\nType y, then hit enter when asked for the file name to save it as (it will default to the one we gave it using the nano command). We can now run the locale-gen command to generate the locale information.\nlocale-gen\n\nWe‚Äôve generated to locale and made them available. Now we can set it as our choice. Enter the language info in a file called locale.conf.\nnano /etc/locale.conf \nEnter‚Ä¶\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\n‚Ä¶into this file, and exit nano as before.\n\n\n\n\nNext up is time zones. We can see a list of the selections using this commands.\nls /usr/share/zoneinfo\n\nYou can see the options under each region using ls on one of the folders shown by the above command, ie‚Ä¶\nls /usr/share/zoneinfo/America\n‚Ä¶to see which region you‚Äôre in:\n\nWe then set the desired zone to our system localtime. This command creates a ‚Äúsymbolic link‚Äù from the zone info data, and associates that link with a new config file called etc/localtime. I‚Äôm in the northeastern US, so for me it‚Äôs:\nln ‚Äìs /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime\nThis should just happen silently.\nNext is the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù clock of our VM. Problems here can lead to trouble updating down the road, so it‚Äôs worth checking that it‚Äôs synced if you run into issues.\nhwclock --systohc --utc\nThis command is also silent when successful.\n\n\n\nNow we create a password for the root user.\npasswd # set your root password\nHere is what your screen should look like:\n\nPractically speaking, I think it‚Äôs worth making a main user at this point, though it isn‚Äôt technically required.\nuseradd -m -g users -G wheel -s /bin/bash username\nThe -m flag creates a /home directory for the new user. The -g flag specifies the group to add the user to. The -G flag refers to auxiliary groups to add the user to. In this case, they‚Äôre added to the wheel group, which will let them be a full admin. /bin/bash specifies what shell the user will have. It‚Äôs typical to use bash. Don‚Äôt forget to change username to the name you want.\n\nGive the user a password:\npasswd username\n\nNow, we allow our users in the wheel group to use sudo. The visudo command makes sure the edits to the file are syntactically legit so you don‚Äôt screw it up with a typo.\nEDITOR=nano visudo\nFind and un-comment the following line:\n%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL\n\n\n\n\nNow to name the machine:\nnano /etc/hostname\nEnter the name you want and exit nano.\n\nNow we need to setup the network inside chroot so we can install the bootloader (up until now, we‚Äôve been getting sweet internet goodness from the host machine, but we‚Äôre hidden away in chroot at the moment). We will install a network manager to enable this. This is a divergence from previous tutorials as well. Run the following command and hit enter to accept the install.\npacman -S dhcpcd\nWe‚Äôve install the network manager, but we need to turn it on. We can do so using the systemctl command.\nsystemctl enable dhcpcd\n\nNow we can install grub, which will allow us to boot into our system. os-prober is sometimes installed at this step. It detects other operating systems if you dual boot, though that won‚Äôt be an issue with a VM. It‚Äôs good to know it exists however.\npacman ‚ÄìS grub os-prober\n\nNow that we have grub, we can install to our /dev/sda drive where is will be able to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the rest of our system:\ngrub-install /dev/sda\nIt should tell you it installed with no errors. This command will create a config file for grub from which we can customize it later if desired.\ngrub-mkconfig ‚Äìo /boot/grub/grub.cfg\nYou should see something like this:\n\nThis is important: what it says it‚Äôs detecting is the Linux kernel we installed earlier. This means grub knows where to look when it‚Äôs time to boot. We can now exit the chroot environment:\nexit\nWe should have a working base system now. To test this, reboot:\nreboot \nYou should be back at the boot screen. Now, try booting into the existing OS to see our system.\n\nYou should see the grub login screen.\n\nSelect ‚ÄúArch Linux‚Äù. You‚Äôll be asked to log in via terminal. Type your username and password.\n\nWe‚Äôre good! If you want a desktop, you can choose whichever you like, and set it up. I‚Äôm going to use Gnome for this because it‚Äôs my go-to, but the point of Arch is that you can use whatever you want and configure it however you like. This will usually entail installing the desktop, and, if it‚Äôs not included in the desktop package, a display manager. First the install (this takes a while - Gnome is full-size desktop):\nsudo pacman -S gnome\nYou may see the following prompt (or a few like it):\n\nThey‚Äôre dependencies used by Gnome. Accepting the defaults is fine (In this case, it‚Äôs an audio component use in the Gnome package).\nNext, enable the Gnome display manager like this:\nsystemctl enable gdm.service\nThis will allow us to use the desktop after boot. Reboot, and you will be greeted with a the Gnome login screen.\nreboot\nYou should now have a working VM. I‚Äôd recommend checking out the Arch Wiki on tweaking the virtual machine for your host OS to allow for fullscreen, shared clipboard, and shared drives.\n\n\n\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide \nhttps://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/install-arch-linux-on-virtualbox/ \n# now retired apparently  https://bigdaddylinux.com/easily-install-arch-linux-in-virtualbox/"

    "text": "UPDATE: One of the articles misused in the piece has been retracted, with the authors calling out Mac Donald by name as misusing their work.\n\n\nUPDATE (07/11/2020): The mysterious quote has been found and unleashed a new error. Brief rundown here, details to follow.\n\nA few weeks ago, I published a video and a summary of some pretty egregious lying with statistics that was published in The Wall Street Journal. I was not the only person to observer this. Since then, authors of one of the studies cited have asked for a retraction, saying they were careless in ways that allowed for misuse of their work. They also call out Heather Mac Donald, the author of the Op-ed, by name.\nI‚Äôd written an essay-style version of my original critique as well, which follows:\nThe recent article ‚ÄúThe Myth of Systemic Police Racism‚Äù[1] contains numerous scientific and journalistic errors that invalidate its core argument and suggest negligence or a desire to mislead the reader.\nFirstly, It cites studies about police shootings in isolation to draw conclusions about all policing activities, which is fundamentally unsound. Similarly the author includes a study of shootings by the Philadelphia Police Department. This does not entitle you to make claims about ‚ÄúPolice‚Äù as an entity - it entitles you to make claims about the Philadelphia Police Department.\nOne of the papers cited[2], a study by Johnson et al, does not make or support the claim that ‚ÄúPolice Racism‚Äù is a ‚Äúmyth‚Äù - it only deals with shootings. Furthermore, two more recent papers analyzed the results of the Johnson paper. The first found, examining its claim ‚Äúthat their results hold across subgroups of victims‚Äù[2]:\n‚Äú.. an alternative model that focused on young (age 20 y), unarmed male victims that showed no signs of mental health problems and were not suicidal in a county with equal proportions of Black and White citizens‚Ä¶ suggested that victims with these characteristics are 13.67 times more likely to be Black than White.‚Äù[3]\nThe other[4] found an issue saying ‚Äúits approach is mathematically incapable of supporting its central claims‚Äù given lack of ability to account for a key probabilistic formula. The authors address this in a correction letter clarifying their intent to state ‚ÄúAs the proportion of White officers in a fatal officer-involved shooting increased, a person fatally shot was not more likely to be of a racial minority‚Äù[5]. This is an interesting finding but not in line with the claim made in the op-ed: ‚Äúno significant evidence of antiblack disparity in the likelihood of being fatally shot by police‚Äù[1]. Strangely, the author presents this as a quote but it does not appear in the paper cited.\nThe authors of the follow-up study brought their findings to light months ago. When I accessed the Johnson paper on June 7th, both papers criticizing it and the correction were linked to in the top of the paper so that readers would see new evidence and place the paper in context; they were published in January. The WSJ piece was published June 2nd.\nPuzzlingly, the author cites Roland G. Fryer, Jr.¬†One of his most famous findings[6] includes a dataset in which police shootings show no racial disparity, but he found that nearly all other uses of force did. In particular, Fryer states ‚ÄùEven when officers report civilians have been compliant and no arrest was made, blacks are 21.2 percent more likely to endure some form of force in an interaction‚Äù[7]. The second sentence of his abstract[7] mentions racial disparities - it‚Äôs hard to imagine a diligent researcher not knowing about this.\nThe best defence of the article is that it‚Äôs an opinion piece. This is insufficient given the confidence with which the author makes their claim and the severity of the scientific errors they make in defending it. The author employs statistical evidence that has been strongly called into question months ago, or is only obliquely and selectively related to their position. Most unforgivably it cites research that goes against its own position out of negligence or a deliberate effort to deceive. Because the piece presumes to inform the reader using quantitative evidence, it should be held to a higher quantitative standard. Given the importance of the subject at hand and considering the speed at which misinformation spreads, ignoring these issues is irresponsible.\nCitations:\n\n[1]‚ÄúThe Myth of Systemic Police Racism - WSJ.‚Äù 2 Jun.¬†2020, https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883.

    "text": "You are not an imposter\nIt‚Äôs sometimes intimidating to be around the kind of people you meet in the Boston biotech scene. It‚Äôs a bustling, affluent area packed with hugely successful companies, top schools, and really smart, driven people.\nIt‚Äôs important to keep in mind you‚Äôre not the only regular person who doesn‚Äôt get it in a sea of geniuses. Nobody is as sharp as they are at their best all the time - you can be a famous professor and still spill coffee on stuff and start talking in a zoom meeting without turning on your microphone all the time.\nEven the biggest rock stars started somewhere, and it‚Äôs more likely they got where they are by making the most of the opportunities they had, working in a persistent, intelligent way, and getting a little lucky than by being a magical genius you could never hope to comprehend.\nSuccess is not guaranteed but keep in mind that you wouldn‚Äôt be here if the committee didn‚Äôt think you had a strong chance to hang in the scene.\n\nA note on ‚Äòmath people‚Äô\nMath has been terrifying bio people from time immemorial (and now they have code to deal with too). I was far from a math person, having struggled in undergrad, feeling as though the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù was missing from the content, before eventually forcing my way into decent standing. The stats used in bioinformatics tend to come from practical concerns, so the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is easier to see. It‚Äôs still hard sometimes (you‚Äôre never really done learning), but it‚Äôs gone from something I dreaded to something I can use practically and enjoy, and I find it‚Äôs one of the main ways I contribute to my team now. The bottom line is that not feeling like a ‚Äòmath person‚Äô doesn‚Äôt rule you out of a productive career for a few reasons:\n\n(Bio)statistics is a quirky subfield of math - you can‚Äôt necessarily assume that having a tough time in trig is going to translate to a tough time here.\nYou can make computers do the grunt work so you can focus on the concepts. We often use code libraries for statistical procedures. This doesn‚Äôt mean you can stop trying to understand what is happening but it does mean you can be effective without remembering what every Greek character in a formula stands for. It also means there are fewer errors along the lines of ‚ÄúDrat, I forgot to carry the 1‚Äù. Understanding what is an appropriate statistical procedure for your situation (or knowing when you don‚Äôt know, and where to look to find out) is more important than being able to write out matrix multiplication by hand.\n\nWhen I was finishing my MS I took a PhD level stats course in each of my final terms, getting an A and a B while working at a co-op full time. I‚Äôm still waiting to feel like a ‚Äúmath person‚Äù. I‚Äôm not, however, waiting to be able to make meaningful contributions in my lab.\n\n\nBioinformatics is hard\nI‚Äôm not saying most people think this field is a cake-walk or anything, but it‚Äôs easy to forget just what we have to juggle. You‚Äôll eventually be expected to know a lot of what a statistician knows, a lot of what a biologist knows, and a lot of what a software developer knows. You don‚Äôt have to be a stats whiz to see the numbers get a little concerning here. It‚Äôs normal to come across something you‚Äôre not familiar with (or don‚Äôt remember well) and to look it up. Which brings me to‚Ä¶"

In a way, if you succeed in the field, you‚Äôll be one for the rest of your life (or at least your career). There is just too much to know.\n\nYour job is to be good at learning stuff now\nFor my first publication, my contribution to the paper was co-writing an app in a language I‚Äôd never used before. What‚Äôs interesting about this is actually how uninteresting it is - this kind of thing happens all the time. Some people say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting a new project, time to learn a new technology!‚Äù and are only half joking. Stay open minded about learning new stuff and get used to searching and reading documentation carefully. The is true for the biological and statistical aspects of the field as well - new methods and findings are being reported all the time.\n\n\nAggressively pursue mentorship\nOne important factor to consider when looking at jobs and co-ops is the availability of a mentor. This is so important to me that when offered a transfer to a new department in my work, I told them my acceptance was contingent on them finding me a biostats mentor. Ask about who you‚Äôll be able to go to when you get stuck, or who will help you learn the job. It doesn‚Äôt have to be one person either - in a field like this you might have somebody you got to to for help with biology concepts and someone else for code. This is fine, just make sure you know these people exist and that you‚Äôll be able to access some of their time. If offered two jobs, one at the most famous institution on earth with an unavailable grouch, and one somewhere you‚Äôve never heard of with someone who cares about teaching, take the second one. You can get fancy later - get good first, and it will be easier.\n\n\nRead\nGrad school is very concentrated in terms of acquiring new information, which is part of the point. However, our field is composed of a lot of nitpicky details - programming minutia, subtle statistical distinctions, complex biological pathways. This isn‚Äôt even to mention the technical processes of sequencing itself. It‚Äôs easy to miss the big picture. Reading this book helped me see the forest through the trees (and I find myself reviewing sections). Review-style papers in scientific journals also help catch you up on a topic at a high level. Additionally, take some time to read articles on biology, medicine, and computation that appear in quality magazines and attend talks that strike your interest (you‚Äôll probably have a chance to do so at a lof of companies, and will be bombarded with invites at most academic institutions).\n\n\nAsk questions\nIt can sometimes be anxiety-inducing to ask a question, especially if you think it‚Äôs a basic one. I know I felt this way sometimes (and still do). It‚Äôs usually worth it though, and more often than not, in my experience, people aren‚Äôt going to give you a hard time about it."

    "text": "Be intentional with your time and energy\n\nGet organized\nDevelop a consistent way of capturing and organizing tasks. It doesn‚Äôt matter what it is, it doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, and it doesn‚Äôt have to be set it stone, but it does need to exist. Find something that works and tweak it as needed. The same goes for planning your days and weeks - do not make a habit of reacting to your day or you‚Äôll be on your heels, stressed, and doing less than your best work for the next 2-3 years.\n\n\nGet good\nThe most important book I‚Äôve ever read is called So Good They Can‚Äôt Ignore you by Cal Newport, who got famous by being good at the kind of things people do in grad school. I read it in 2012 and I still consider the ideas in it when making all my career decisions. Consider reading it, or find a detailed summary.\n\nPractice\nThis might seen obvious but is easy to overlook - learning new languages, programming or otherwise, requires practice. Passive consumption of material is often needed to start a new skill but you won‚Äôt ever get good enough to hire without pushing yourself to new levels by enacting what you know in a repeated, focused way. There is nothing wrong with repeating exercises that still challenge you. Don‚Äôt look at coding like collecting information you need to know, think of it as practicing for a recital. In the internet age, simply knowing stuff takes a back seat to being able to do something with what you know to an even greater degree because most information is a search away.\n\n\n\nFocus\nDoing well at things that are hard generally requires focus and skill. Grad school is hard (in and of itself) and so are the individual things you will do. Make time to really dive into them without interruptions. More on this (another key book for me) is here, also from Newport.\n\nMultitasking is, by and large, a myth\n‚ÄúMultitasking‚Äù on substantive mental work is not real. What people think of as multitasking is just switching between tasks in alternation. This costs more energy than doing two things one at a time. Your mental energy is perhaps the most valuable currency you have in terms of getting graduate-level work done - don‚Äôt pay extra taxes on it when you don‚Äôt need to.\n\n\nUse social media thoughtfully\nSocial media apps are an attempt, by some of the most world‚Äôs most successful companies, to take your attention away from where you intended to put it. They are deliberately designed, using the same psychological principles that went into the slot machine, to produce addictive behaviors and maximize the time you spend on them. This principle is in direct tension with working intentionally and focusing on difficult material. It‚Äôs hard to find two hours a day, but that‚Äôs how much time most Americans spend on social media. The cost of this is greater if it makes it harder to focus even when you‚Äôre not on it (by training your brain to stop what it‚Äôs doing and look for a reward). I‚Äôm not saying using them has no benefits or that they will turn you into a zombie, but it‚Äôs worth being intentional about how you engage with them, attempting to get the benefits of socializing with minimal drawbacks. For me this looks like checking the platform I like one or twice a day in a browser for a few minutes, but not having it on a mobile device during the work week. The 30 seconds I spend installing it and logging in on Saturdays are nothing next to the mental health and productivity benefits I felt after using it on my terms, not the terms of the people who profit from me (why would they have my best interest in mind?). Some people might be fine with their habits as-is and what works is personal, so experiment if you feel the need to - you can read more about this kind of thing here.\n\n\n\nGet stuck as soon as possible\nThis might sound weird, but when you‚Äôre working on an assignment, think of your job as getting stuck as soon as possible. When you‚Äôre planning your work, assume you will get stuck and need to wait on a reply from a (probably very busy) classmate, TA, or instructor. Getting as far as you can as soon as you can helps you get things in on time and also make it easier to help you - if we‚Äôre sending a rushed reply or trying to squeeze in a meeting, we‚Äôre not going to have as much time to get into the material in detail. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt ask for help as things get closer to being due, just that it‚Äôs a better experience for both parties if you start early enough to know if you need a hand."

He is a really smart dude - he had a seemingly inexhaustible knowledge of cell and molecular bio, could lecture beautifully for hours from a single page of notes, and had published as a post-doc at a top university. I assumed he had some workflow that I could never dream up. I was surprised by the simplicity of his answer when he told me he wished he slept more during school. He felt he would have retained more information. Even the highest performers answer to their physiology. I‚Äôm not saying I made it though grad school without a few all-nighters (or real late nights), especially balancing a job for most of it. But they were rare. Prevent as many as you can by being strategic.\n\n\nMaintain a compartment for your life\nGrad school is great at invading your life. I found though, that by planning carefully and focusing hard, I didn‚Äôt have to give up everything. If playing board games with your friends on the weekend is what gets you through the day, plan around it. You‚Äôre probably going to take a few hits in terms of what you have the time and energy for, but, with care, your outlets can take care of you, if you take care of them.\n\n\nAsk for help\nIf you‚Äôre struggling personally, help is available and you should use it. Grad school is hard enough without leaving help on the table."

    "text": "You‚Äôre a quant now\nCongrats, nerd.\n\nTake statistics seriously (and early)\nA lot of work in our field is executed by code but motivated by statistics. I personally loved learning to code (and still do) - I love stats too, but it was less intuitive to get started. Code will sometimes tell you when you‚Äôre wrong with an error or a warning - a statistical test will not, silently letting you draw bogus conclusions. Thus, it pays to take it seriously, not just a means to and end. Give these classes the attention they deserve, and‚Ä¶\n\n\nConsider a data science elective (DA5020/5030)\nThere is statistics in the program, but it‚Äôs an important thing and there is too much to learn in one semester. Additionally, these additional courses may also expose you to the nuts and bolts of getting datasets in out of a database and messing around with them, which isn‚Äôt always covered in more theoretical stats courses. They may also include ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù related topics in addition to more ‚Äúclassical‚Äù statistics. That being said..\n\n\nMachine learning is built on statistical foundations\nPlease do not be the person who doesn‚Äôt know what logistic regression is for but tries to solve every problem using a neural network. It‚Äôs good to explore, and neural nets are awesome, so you should learn about them eventually. But they‚Äôre made of pieces of statistics - it‚Äôs been said a neural net is just a bunch of logistic regressions standing on top of one another in a trench coat - and you‚Äôll want to know what those pieces are. Misunderstanding and net can lead to sorrow, so be wary of putting the cart before the horse. They are one one of many tools, all of which have different uses, strengths, and weaknesses (the drawbacks of a neural nets beyond the scope of this article but are important enough to look into).\n\n\nLearn (make your peace with?) R\nThe R programming language is notoriously quirky. It‚Äôs also built from the ground up to eat statistics of basically any complexity for breakfast. The phrases I‚Äôve uttered in painstakingly becoming a proficient R users would make a British soccer (er, football) fan blush. In fact, I learned it only because I was tricked and forced into doing so by an out-of-date course description that promised me sweet, beautiful Python. I was pretty salty at the time, but this is easily the best annoying thing that ever happened to my career. People all over the place are just waiting to blow up the slack channel asking you for plots, and R is galaxy-class tool for getting them the goods. A few things:\n\nYou won‚Äôt escape R for differential expression, and lots of people are going to ask you to do this for them.\nLook up sleuth, limma-voom, and DESeq2 if you think this these experiments are coming your way on co-op. If it‚Äôs not obvious which is right for the experiment, I go for limma-voom.\n\n\nUse the tidyverse\nThis is essentially a dialect of R at this point. Using tidyverse R vs ‚Äúbase‚Äù R is the kind of thing people fight on twitter or get ideological about, but ignore that. It‚Äôs more practical to start with the tidyverse for most people (way less quirky and obtuse, extremely well documented). dplyr and ggplot2 should be among the first components you learn.\n\n\nCheck your types\nDo this in any language, but especially R. Part of why makes R weird is the ‚Äútype system‚Äù it uses, so read up on how to check what types are in your dataframe (class, and similar functions). Read about the factor type. We can talk more about R later - let me know if you‚Äôre interested, but I‚Äôm pushing it in terms of the scope of this article already."

If you‚Äôre writing anything that‚Äôs bigger than a throw-away, one-off script, make it into a git repo (I made one just for this article). If you‚Äôre not yet experienced enough to tell if it‚Äôs a throw-away, one-off script, put it in git just in case. If you think you‚Äôre experienced enough to tell, you might be mistaken, so it couldn‚Äôt hurt to put it into git anyway. Commit and push your work all the time. It‚Äôs difficult to overstate the importance of version control to a good workflow. Think of it like backing up the data on your phone, except that you can instantly go back to every version of your data. And make ‚Äúbranches‚Äù of your data where you try and save different things in different ways, so two or more working versions can exist. And, if you like one version better, you can make it the new official version. Or merge them both into one. Or send it to a friend, and have them make a version, which will exist without messing with your version. I once needed to exactly recreate a plot of randomly partitioned data from 6 months prior for the VP of Data Science at my co-op. I‚Äôd forgotten how I did it and deleted the code from my computer. If I hadn‚Äôt been using git carefully, I‚Äôd have been toast. If you‚Äôre on a project of non-trivial size or importance and someone tells you that you don‚Äôt need version control, it should feel like they just told you ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to brush my teeth‚Äù.\nUPDATE: A while back I made a video of a very simple git workflow. You can check it out here.\n\n\nRead the error message, then paste it into a search engine\nSeriously, the degree to which this will make your life easier is almost absurd. You‚Äôre going to be seeing error messages in several languages throughout the semester and many more in your career. This is where a lot of your time blocks will come from. If the code is syntactically incorrect, it simply won‚Äôt run, and there is no way to know if it will take you ten seconds or ten hours to fix it. Luckily, I learned this early on when I took an error I had to a TA and he simply copied out of my terminal and into a search bar. A post on how to fix it was in the first few results. The internet is bursting with people who want to know why their code is broken, and there are many forums of questions with answers to common questions. Get used to navigating them.\n\n\nIf a post bails you out, bookmark it\nGetting stuck is a pain. Getting stuck on something you‚Äôve been stuck on before but can‚Äôt recall how to fix is a huge pain. Bookmark or clip posts that save your butt.\n\n\nUse a virtual machine or spare laptop if you want to tinker with a Linux system\nI found it fun to explore Linux - different software, distros (I use Arch BTW), and desktop environments, and so on. However, if you tell a Linux terminal to do something insane, and you have the authority to do so, it will listen to you. Sometimes this leads to a learning experience such as ‚ÄúHmm, why is my desktop gone?‚Äù (true story) or ‚ÄúHey, GRUB is broken and my computer boots to a black screen and flashing white cursor, what do I do now?‚Äù (true story 3+ times). If you want to break stuff and learn to fix it, that‚Äôs awesome, just don‚Äôt do it on the machine you‚Äôre taking a final on tomorrow.\n\n\nMake something\nIt‚Äôs nice to have a portfolio, hosted somewhere like GitHub, where you can show off things you‚Äôve made. If you do a creative final project, clean it up and put it somewhere public so you can flex for future employers. I also found it fun to do coding or data projects on random things I found interesting, and to show those off too. This will set you apart from those who can only show homework they did. You can look at my site or portfolio for a sense of what these might look like, but don‚Äôt be afraid to do you own thing."

    "text": "Overview of the opioid epidemic [1]\nThe opioid epidemic is a public health phenomenon in which the rates of opioid overdose deaths increased ninefold between 1999 and 2018.\n\nPhase 1: Prescription use in urban white populations [1]\nWhen the epidemic was first observed no particular racial trends were apparent. With time, the trend grew in white populations in urban regions with well developed supply chains. Evidence suggests black patients are less likely to receive opioids for similar conditions and pain levels than white patients, which is considered a possible explanation for this trend. Some increase in use was also noted in US Native populations.\n\n\nPhase 2: Illegal heroin, fentanyl, and demographic generalization. [1]\nIn the 2010s the trend extended to other demographics. State interventions aimed at decreasing prescription of opioids coincide with an increase in the use of illegal heroin, with some theorizing the regulations drove users to the underground market - evidence suggests a significant amount of illegal heroin users used prescription opioids first. The west coast illegal markets were largely based on ‚Äúblack tar‚Äù heroin from Mexico, whereas the east coast supply revolved around Columbian heroin. The east coast product was highly pure and less expensive, driving down the cost of the drug in general. In 2013 the illegal market saw the emergence of fentanyl, a drug that is easier to produce and 30-40 times stronger than heroin. This was especially true on the east coast and a surge of fentanyl-related deaths followed.\n\n\nGeographic shifts [1]\nAs the epidemic evolved, the geographic regions changed, moving from urban regions to Appalachia, the Midwest, and the Northeast. Areas most affected by deindustrialization show the worst increase, though the trend is observed in all states."

Around the same time Purdue Pharmaceuticals released OxyContin, an extended release version of oxycodone. The company funded campaigns promoting the use of opioids, and the industry as a whole spent tens of millions of dollars promoting their use to physicians.\n\n\nDemand [1]\nOpioid use disorder is associated with poor access to education and employment opportunities by a significant body of literature, as is drug use overall. Increase in opioid use disorder trends strongly with deindustrialization. Further understanding recent trends in other demographics is an area of need for research."

    "text": "Policy\nNumerous laws have targeted legal and illegal opioid use [1].\n\nSupply-side [1]\nSome laws target the prescribing of opioids. There is not currently a large body of evidence on these laws. Short-term evidence does not indicate an effect on misuse, and there is some evidence restrictions on prescribing increases demand in the illegal market. There is evidence programs that monitor prescribing closely decrease deaths from prescription drugs but are also associated with an increase in deaths from illegal opioids. As the epidemic evolved, providers became more aware and guidelines may have decreased prescribing overall.\n\nCriminalization [1]\nCriminalization incentivizes the use of illegal drugs which are becoming cheaper and more dangerous. It is also the most widespread intervention. There are decades of evidence that the policies promoted by the War on Drugs have little impact on the use of drugs. Stricter laws theoretically intended to punish serious traffickers are used to charge friends and families of users nearly half the time they‚Äôre used. Many incarcerated individuals used opioids prior to arrest, and individuals recently released from prison are at increased risk of overdose.\n\n\nHarm reduction [1]\nHarm reduction measures aim to promote use of drugs in ways that have a lower probability of a bad outcome.\n\n‚ÄúGood Samaritan‚Äù laws [1]\nGood Samaritan Laws aim to increase the willingness of individuals using drugs to contact emergency services by offering them legal protections. In theory, someone using drugs and witnessing another individual overdose could get them medical attention with less fear of reprisal. Evidence of the effectiveness of these laws is limited and mixed. Understanding their impact is an area of research need.\n\n\nNaloxone access [1]\nNaloxone (Narcan) is a drug that counteracts the respiratory effects of an overdose. Evidence from regions that implement laws to facilitate access to it shows a decrease in deaths from overdose. Concern that access to treatment with Naloxone or easing punishments for drug crimes will increase use it cited as a reason for hesitancy in these interventions. Initial evidence showed an increase in use in a before/after study of these interventions, though it was a single study and did not control for increasing use in general. Two more recent studies show no increase in use with access to this tool.\n\n\nSafer use practices [1]\nSafer-use measures may take the form of needle exchanges or safe-use facilities where drugs are taken in a controlled environment. Safe use measures are associated with a decrease in deaths in other countries (non-US). There are currently campaigns to attempt these measures in New York and Philadelphia, though ‚ÄúNIMBYism‚Äù (‚ÄúNot In My Back Yard‚Äù-ism)i is a possible barrier. Fentanyl detection strips allow users to asses if they have a product contaminated by stronger drugs. Evidence suggests the strips decrease use somewhat but individuals do not appear willing to dispose of the product overall.\n\n\n\n\nDemand-side [1]\nThese approaches involve treatment of the disorder itself as a opposed to controlling the supply.\n\nTreatment [1]\nMedications that treat opioid use disorder have been studied and shown to reduce opioid use. There are three such medications: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. The first two are the gold standard of care given the amount of evidence accumulated over time to support their use, including multiple longitudinal studies. Crucially, however, the majority of those treated for opioid use disorder do not receive any such medications (commonly know as ‚ÄúMedications for opioid use disorder‚Äù, or MOUD). Most programs do not offer them. Many patients who receive them stop taking them. Studies of barriers to adoption of medications among treatment providers show regulatory and fiscal obstacles as driver of this difficulty. Clinics offering methadone must receive a specific license from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and patients must visit the clinic daily. Buprenorphine can be given as a take-home treatment, but the DEA requires prescribing physicians to obtain a waiver for this use. Medication-based programs often have rigid compliance standards for additional services like therapy and some demand total abstinence from other substances, increasing the difficulty for some patients."

    "text": "I am sitting in a coffee shop at school, theoretically so I can clear some e-todos and paperwork from my ledger, but I just realized something weird so I have to write a blog post.\nIt all started with me contemplating the term ‚Äúpythonic‚Äù. For those who haven‚Äôt heard it before, it‚Äôs jargon from the Python programming community to describe something that fits the style and technique of Python well. One might say something ‚Äúpythonic‚Äù is ‚Äúidiomatic‚Äù Python.\nTaking a step back, an idiom in normal language according to The Notorious O.E.D is:\n1. A group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words (e.g., rain cats and dogs, see the light).\n2. A characteristic mode of expression in music or art.\n‚Äòthey were both working in a neo-impressionist idiom‚Äô\nA classic idiom that is surprisingly well-conserved* all over the damn place¬†is ‚ÄúWhen pigs fly‚Äù. True to definition 1A, this conveys no real information about what you‚Äôre talking about except that which a familiar listener has come to understand it does.\nAn example of the 2A sort would be all the references to having ‚Äú99 Xs but a Y ain‚Äôt one‚Äù that appear in pop culture since Jay-Z released ‚Äú99 Problems‚Äù, making a phrase Ice-T said in one song part of every day speech . If you want to get old school with it, think ‚ÄúI woke up this morning‚Äù (Da dum dum da) in a blues song (Did someone leave the radio on? It‚Äôs getting a little ‚ÄòNPR‚Äô in here!).\nSometimes someone or something quirky is described as ‚Äòidiosyncratic‚Äô, like Bob Dylan‚Äôs voice (or maybe Bob Dylan in general). You can follow this train of thinking all the way down to a specific person‚Äôs ‚Äúidiolect‚Äù if you want to go as hard as this guy. In either case, we‚Äôre talking about traits that belong to a subset, even if that subset is one person.\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that something doesn‚Äôt have to be idiomatic to be correct, it‚Äôs just not what someone who is fully localized might say. On the street corner, this might be the difference between:\n‚ÄúPardon me. I require help to find the subway‚Äù\nand:\n‚ÄúExcuse me, which way‚Äôs the train?‚Äù\nYou know what they both mean and neither are incorrect, but you could probably tell which one of these folks was on vacation. Anyway‚Ä¶\nBack to the coding example, something pythonic is python written the way a ‚Äòfluent‚Äô user would write it, and that embodies the traits Python is designed to facilitate. This often means it is concise, simple, and easy to read. It might even be an expression that is so common nobody knows who wrote it first, just like with human languages.\nExamples, you say? Take a look at the following code:\n# print out each letter of a string\nname = \"Guido\"\nnumber = 0\nwhile number > len(name):\n    print(name[number])\n    number = number + 1\n\nThis code achieves what it set out to do; there is nothing really ‚Äòwrong‚Äô with it (you‚Äôd still know they guy needs to get to the train, if you will). We all write stuff like this once in a while, and if we‚Äôre just trying to get a quick idea out for a prototype, it‚Äôs probably not worth slowing down to mess with. But it‚Äôs decidedly not pythonic.\nFor starters, Python would be more likely to sidestep the counter all together. The ‚ÄòWhile‚Äô loop could easily be the more widely understood ‚ÄòFor‚Äô, and the incrementer in line X could be written more concisely . Let‚Äôs give it a try.\nname = ‚ÄúGuido‚Äù\nfor letter in name:\n    print (letter)\n\nBoom. We‚Äôre down from 5 lines to 3. You could get down to 2 if you wanted to, (put the print() statement right after the : in the line above it) but this is the more typical.\nThe ‚Äòfor‚Äô takes care of the iteration for us, and we take advantage of a default variable we can define as we see fit, ‚Äòletter‚Äô. This would run with any string there, but why not take advantage of the human friendly syntax opportunity? It‚Äôs worth noting that ‚Äòi‚Äô, is often used and is idiomatic in programming in general (the incrementer, in this case, is replaced by the for-loop but would be more idiomatically written ‚Äúnumber + =1‚Äù).\nThat gets the point across, but the example is simple and easy to fix. Let‚Äôs look at something a little more true to life. Try this on for size:\n# filter out names that are 3 characters or less.\nnames = [\"Ada\", \"Mary\", \"Bev\", \"Margaret\", \"Rosalind\"]\nshort_names = []\nfor name in names:\n    if len(name) <= 3:\n        short_names.append(name)\n\nThis snippet sets out to do something slightly more complicated even though it‚Äôs also 5 lines long: there is a condition of the list containing unprocessed entries and a check of length. The reason I wrote it this way is because it‚Äôs less obvious how it could be made more pythonic, but it can be done, and using an especially python-y move: a list comprehension.\nObserve:\nnames = [\"Ada\", \"Mary\", \"Bev\", \"Margaret\", \"Rosalind\"]\nshort_names = [name for name in names if len(name) <= 3]\n\nWhoa, now! Is it all even there?\nThese can seem a little intimidating at first, but they are super handy**. If you just read through slowly, all of the same idea are expressed, just more smoothly. This is probably the ‚Äòexpression‚Äô (idiom) that more experienced users would use, so it is worth noting.\nThe ‚Äò=‚Äô and the [] define the new list as a list, and the condition is basically typed in (somewhat awkward) English and that‚Äôs it.\nA skeptical reader might be wondering about the philosophy behind this. The Zen of Python states that it is better to be explicit that implicit, but this feels a bit like a shortcut, no? At least, that‚Äôs a question that came to my mind; maybe it is glaringly obviously to everyone else on the planet.\nHere‚Äôs the thing though: all of the logical components of the first code are carried over into the second. Python isn‚Äôt trying to ‚Äòguess‚Äô what we mean from context (nothing is implicit). The only thing that is different is how the command is structured, and that structure is more succinct. I like to read them in English, as well as one can, to illustrate the point.\nThe first one would look something like this:\n‚ÄúHere is a list of names called names‚Äù\n‚ÄúCreate an empty list name short_names‚Äù\n‚Äú‚Ä¶for each name in names‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚Äú‚Ä¶if the length is less than or equal to 3..‚Äù\n‚Äú‚Ä¶add that name to the short name list.‚Äù\nThe second:\n‚ÄúHere is a list of names called names‚Äù\n‚ÄúCreate a list called short names that has each name from names if its length is three or less‚Äù\nThere are no important words in the first example that the second doesn‚Äôt have. Because all of the same ideas are there, it‚Äôs just shorter, I say it fits the philosophy.\nIdioms pop up all over the place in code, in all sorts of languages, and have done so since well before Python was invented. I‚Äôm willing to bet most programmers have seen this, or something like it, even if they never wrote a line of C code in their life.\nint main() { for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ¬†¬†¬†¬†printf(‚ÄúThe number is %d‚Äù, i); } return 0;\nThat ‚Äòfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)‚Äô expression, in one form or another, appears EVERYWHERE. C, C++, C#, Java, Perl, Groovy, JavaScript - it‚Äôs there. Hell, even Golang,¬†a mere ten years old at the time of this writing and designed to balance old school power with new school syntax has a modified version of that old chestnut***.\nIn closing I share the random thought that started this rant: Saying something is pythonic is basically using an idiom to describe how idiomatic something is. Huh.\nI hope this has been illuminating and/or interesting, and thanks for reading!\nFootnotes:\n¬†\n*The expressions ‚Äòwell conserved‚Äô is used all the time in evolutionary biology to describe a protein that varies vary little from species to species. Idiom!\n¬†\n**For example, if you needed a quick Python program to describe Jay-Z‚Äôs problems, you can say a lot in one line, much like the man himself:\ncurrent_probs = [prob for prob in old_probs if prob != ‚ÄúB*tch‚Äù]\n¬†\n***this is an idiom."
