My work falls roughly into five (often overlapping) spheres. 

### General Research Programming

I work on <a href="https://microrna-atlas.omics.kitchen/"> apps </a>
that complement <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.804164/full"> publications </a> 
to make their content easier to use and increase engagement.

### Original Software

I work on creating new software for unmet needs. One example is our <a href="https://covid.omics.kitchen/"> Bayesian COVID Diagnostics app.</a> This serves to complement our <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-021-06257-7"> manuscript </a> on lateral flow assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as providing the user with an easy-to-use tool to avoid the pitfalls of black-and-white thinking about diagnostics and counter-intuitive conditional 
probability. Another is <a href="https://omics-kitchen.github.io/ContrApption/#"> ContrApption</a>, which is a JavaScript-powered R package that allows to user to create an interactive widget for exploring the results of differential expression experiments or any dataset with similar structure.

### Statistics for biomarkers

I work on statistical analysis for biomarkers of potential use in Alzheimer's Dementia and Neurological symptoms of COVID-19. 
We've got two manuscripts submitted and a few more nearing completion in the sphere, so stay tuned and see my CV for the titles
if you're curious.

### Statistics and genomics for basic science

For an example of this, check out our <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.03.458085v1"> manuscript </a>
on stress-dependent signatures of cellular and extracellular tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs). We're interested in this from a basic science perspective as well as a potential avenue of biomarkers for diseases.

### "Hacktivism"

I had the privilege of contributing to a <a href="https://mapandscorecard.freefrom.org/"> web tool </a> that allows
users to interact with a dataset that ranks the states in the US based on how well they support the financial well-being of survivors of domestic abuse. I did this as a member of <a href="https://ragtag.org/"> RagTag </a> in support of
<a href="https://www.freefrom.org/"> FREEFROM.</a>

<!-- ## Formal academic-style bio:

Thadryan is a former volunteer Firefighter/EMT and Human Services worker turned Data Scientist interested in biostatistics, programming, and interactive data visualization. He studied Human Biology at Greenfield Community College and American International College and worked in custom antibody production before earning his MS in Bioinformatics at Northeastern University. There he served as a Teaching Assistant for the colleges of Science and Computer and Information Science and completed a co-op at bluebird bio in Cambridge where he stayed on as a contractor while finishing his MS. After graduating he came to Mass General to provide statistical and programming support to the Cardiovascular Research Center before moving to ACTRU. He also teaches an online introductory course in the program where he earned his MS. Thadryan will be leaving ACTRU to pursue a PhD. When not at work he enjoys music, RPGs, and cartooning. -->
