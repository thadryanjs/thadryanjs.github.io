	<h2> Hi there, I'm Thadryan ~ </h2>
	<h3> (Yes, that's my real name) </h3>
	<p> I'm a Firefighter and Human Services Professional turned Computational Biologist interested in statistics,
		data visualization, and biomarker discovery. I am currently at Mass General Hospital where I work in the 
		<a href="https://www.actru.org/"> Alzheimer's Clinical & Translational Research Unit.</a> 
		Before moving to ACTRU, I did statistics and web app development for studies of SARS-Cov-2 and various heart diseases at the Cardiovascular Research Center.
		I also teach an introductory class in the Bioinformatics MS program at Northeastern University. 
		If you're interested in seeing what I'm working on professionally, check out my
		<a href="/CV"> CV</a> or my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/thadryan-sweeney-10b938a> LinkedIn. </a>
		When I'm not doing science-y stuff, I play RPGs, write music, or make cartoons.
