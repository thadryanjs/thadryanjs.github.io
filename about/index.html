	<h2> Hi there, I'm Thadryan ~ </h2>

    <h3> (Yes, that's my real name) </h3>

      <p> I'm a Firefighter and Human Services Professional turned Data Scientist interested in statistics,
        interactive visualization, and biomarker discovery. I do statistically oriented biology research using R, Python,
        and JavaScript. I am currently at Mass General Hospital where I work in the 
        <a href="https://www.actru.org/"> Alzheimer's Clinical & Translational Research Unit.</a> 
        Before moving to ACTRU, I did statistics and web app development for studies of SARS-Cov-2 and various heart diseases
        at the Cardiovascular Research Center. I also teach an introductory class in the Bioinformatics MS program at Northeastern
        University. If you're interested in seeing what I'm working on professionally, check out my
        <a href="/CV"> CV </a> or my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/thadryan-sweeney-10b938a> LinkedIn. </a>
        When I'm not doing science-y stuff, I play RPGs, write music, or make cartoons.
      </p>

  <h2> What I work on </h2>

    My work falls roughly into four (often overlapping) spheres. 

    <h3> General Research Programming </h3>

      <p> 
        I work on <a href="https://microrna-atlas.omics.kitchen/"> apps </a>
        that complement <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.804164/full"> publications </a> 
        to make their content easier to use and increase engagement.
      </p>

    <h3> Statistics for biomarkers </h3>
      
      <p> 
        I work on statistical analysis for biomarkers of potential use in Alzheimer's Dementia and Neurological symptoms of COVID-19. 
        We've got two manuscripts submitted and a few more nearing completion in the sphere, so stay tuned and see my CV for the titles
        if you're curious.
      </p>

    <h3> Statistics and genomics for basic science </h3>

      <p> 
        Advanced Science has recently accepted our <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.03.458085v1"> manuscript </a>
        on stress-dependent signatures of cellular and extracellular tRNA-derived small RNAs (tDRs). We're interested in this from a basic science
        perspective as well as a potential avenue of biomarkers for diseases.
      </p>

    <h3> "Hacktivism" </h3>

      <p> 
        I had the privilege of contributing to a <a href="https://mapandscorecard.freefrom.org/"> web tool </a> that allows
        users to interact with a dataset that ranks the states in the US based on how well they support the financial well-being of survivors of
        domestic abuse. I did this as a member of <a href="https://ragtag.org/"> RagTag </a> in support of
        <a href="https://www.freefrom.org/"> FREEFROM. </a>.
      </p>

	<h2> Formal academic-style bio: </h2>
  
    <p>
      Thadryan is a former volunteer Firefighter/EMT and Human Services worker turned Data Scientist interested in biostatistics, programming,
      and interactive data visualization. He studied Human Biology at Greenfield Community College and American International College and worked
      in custom antibody production before earning his MS in Bioinformatics at Northeastern University. There he served as a Teaching Assistant for the colleges
      of Science and Computer and Information Science and completed a co-op at bluebird bio in Cambridge where he stayed on as a contractor while finishing his MS.
      After graduating he came to Mass General to provide statistical and programming support to the Cardiovascular Research Center before moving to ACTRU.
      He also teaches an online introductory course in the program where he earned his MS. Thadryan will be leaving ACTRU to pursue a PhD.
      When not at work he enjoys music, RPGs, and cartooning.
