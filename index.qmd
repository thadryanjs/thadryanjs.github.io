I'm a Firefighter and Human Services Professional turned Data Scientist interested in statistics, interactive visualization, and biomarker discovery. I do statistically oriented biology research using R, Python, and JavaScript. I'm currently pursing a PhD in <a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/qbs/">Quantitative Biomedical Sciences</a>.

Before starting my doctorate, I was at Mass General Hospital where I worked in the <a href="https://www.actru.org/"> Alzheimer's Clinical & Translational Research Unit.</a> 
Before moving to ACTRU, I did statistics and web app development for studies of SARS-Cov-2 and various heart diseases
at the <a href="https://cvrc.massgeneral.org/"> Cardiovascular Research Center.</a> 

I also taught an introductory class in the 
<a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-bioinformatics-online-14245/">Bioinformatics MS </a>
program at Northeastern University. If you're interested in seeing what I'm working on professionally, check out my <a href="/CV"> CV </a> or my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/thadryan-sweeney-10b938a> LinkedIn. </a>
When I'm not doing science-y stuff, I play RPGs, write music, or make cartoons.
