I'm a Firefighter and Human Services Professional turned Data Scientist interested in statistical approaches to understanding and optimizing biomedical systems large and small. My goal is to conduct research that leads to more efficient use of resources, more personalized care, and that reduces friction and suffering.

I'm currently pursing a PhD in <a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/qbs/">Quantitative Biomedical Sciences</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://wesleymarrero.wixsite.com/home"> Wesley Marrero </a> of the <a href="https://or.engineering.dartmouth.edu"> Operations Research Group</a>. My current research focuses on understanding opioid-related harms and access to medications for opioid use disorder.

Before starting my doctorate, I worked at Mass General Hospital evaluating biomarkers in the <a href="https://www.actru.org/"> Alzheimer's Clinical & Translational Research Unit </a> and the <a href="https://cvrc.massgeneral.org/"> Cardiovascular Research Center</a>.

I also taught an introductory class in the
<a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-bioinformatics-online-14245/">Bioinformatics MS </a>
program at Northeastern University.
