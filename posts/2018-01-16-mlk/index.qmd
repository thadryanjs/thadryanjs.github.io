Hello Everyone!

I would like to wish everyone a happy MLK day. It isn't much, but as an act of respect and commemoration, I though I would share an example of how a beautiful speech can, with relative ease, be turned into a striking visual. We will, of course, be working with the monolithic "I Have a Dream" speech.

I used the R programming language for this, as I have worked more extensively with text with it than Python, and don't use it as often and want to keep up my skills. If you'd like to see the [rundown](http://i.imgur.com/YQv88cp.png), here is the [workbook](http://pythoninthewyld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/workbook.html), if not, the final product is below!

Enjoy, and once again, happy Martin Luther King day!
