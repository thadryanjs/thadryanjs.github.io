Salutations!  

A friend of mine recently asked me for some pointers on Python import statements, and I thought I would share what I came up with. The import command allows us to use code from other libraries, directories, source files, etc. It's a fundamental tools that's been around since way before Python (think "\#include \<stdio.h\>", and further). The structure is easier to demonstrate if we break from our go-to Jupyter format, so have a look at the project [here](https://github.com/sweeney-th/importsExample). Have a look at the code in utils.py, `OtherUtils/utils\_one\_dir_down.py`, and then read the mains!
