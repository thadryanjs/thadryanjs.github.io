A while ago I shared a first run and an epitope analysis tool called ASH (Antigen Selection Heuristic). The tool aims to provide a rough estimate of chemical distinctness in two aligned protein sequences. I've since gone over the code, organized the repository, fixed a small bug, and added unit tests. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/sweeney-th/Portfolio/tree/master/ASH), and it includes a [walk-through](https://github.com/sweeney-th/Portfolio/blob/master/ASH/documentation/ASH_demo.ipynb). Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback!
