Last year, I read an [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/) on [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) about gun deaths in the US. Intrigued, and looking for some practice, I started poking around in the [dataset](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data) myself. I noticed what seemed to an odd drop in February of each year, and it got me curious about seasonality in the dataset. I've returned to it to give it a proper look. If you're curious, you can see the project [here](http://pythoninthewyld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Main.nb_.html).
