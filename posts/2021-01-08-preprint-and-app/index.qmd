Our [lab](https://www.omics.kitchen/) has been working with a number of collaborators on a study of lateral flow assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We've designed and implemented an interactive [app](https://covid.omics.kitchen/) to complement the [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.20248998v1). Interested parties getting an antibody test are advised to speak with their healthcare provider about interpreting their results with that app, which uses local COVID19 prevelance data from [usafacts.org](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/) (also used by the CDC) and measurments from the study to estimate the probability they do or do not have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies given their result.
