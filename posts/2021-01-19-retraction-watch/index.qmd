I recently saw a [tweet](https://twitter.com/RetractionWatch/status/1350098097695842310?s=20) about retracted papers that still pick up citations so I thought I'd create a tool to help researchers double check themselves. I call it [Rygor](https://github.com/sweeney-th/Rygor). It takes a file of paper names, auotomatically submits them to RWDB, and generates a report stating if it found each paper to be at risk for matching a retracted one. I may add more features to it depending on time, such as automatically pulling th citations from a web page, etc, depending on the availability of structured citation data, APIs, etc.
