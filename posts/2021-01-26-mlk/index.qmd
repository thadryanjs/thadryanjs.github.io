For most of the last few years, I've made wordclouds of famous speeches MLK to mark the holiday that bears his name - they're [here](https://sweeney-th.github.io/2018/01/16/in-honor-of-mlk-i-have-a-dream-wordcloud-example-in-r/) and [here](https://sweeney-th.github.io/2020/01/20/in-honor-of-mlk-2020-i-have-a-dream-wordcloud-example-in-r/). This year, I revisted the "I Have A Dream" speech with some new knowledge and tools and created the following as I reflected on the importance of the legacy of the day.

The source code leverages the [wordcloud](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/wordcloud/versions/2.6  ) and [wordcloud2](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/wordcloud2/versions/0.2.1) packages and is published [here](https://github.com/sweeney-th/MLK-wordclouds).
